# Difference in word duration 

400.549 - 321.397

# Difference in vowel duration

85.63 - 131.984

#Difference in intensity 

69.68704195896734 - 69.85995695029273

#Difference in pitch 

229.8355132225267 - 280.65076946209143
```

# Conclusion

In conclusion, the duration of the stressed hablo is longer than that of the unstressed version. The same pattern is observed in the vowel, with the stressed vowel being longer than the unstressed one. Intensity, however, does not show a significant difference. Regarding pitch, the unstressed o has a higher pitch than the stressed one.
